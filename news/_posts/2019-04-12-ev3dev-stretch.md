Thanks to everyone who has downloaded `ev3dev-stretch` snapshots, tested the
latest kernel and reported issues on GitHub. We're declaring ev3dev-stretch
as the new stable version of ev3dev.

<!--more-->

That means we're saying so-long to `ev3dev-jessie` and hello to `ev3dev-buster`
as the new experimental version of ev3dev (we tend to lag behind one release
from the official Debian project that ev3dev is based on). There might not be as
much development going on as there used to be, but more people are using ev3dev
now than there ever have been. We hope you have as much fun using it as we have
had making it!

**Note:** If you _really_, _really_ need ev3dev-jessie, you can still find the
downloads on the [GitHub releases][1] page.
