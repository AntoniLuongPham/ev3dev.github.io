title: "SD Card Image Release"
---

Yea! No more three hour apt-get upgrades for new installs!

Not much new except for updated packages, so if your packages are already up
to date, there is no need to wipe out your existing SD card. There are a couple
of new packages that you do need to install though: `iptables` and `ev3dev-connman-config`.

Here is the [download] and the [release notes].
