The ev3dev news has been quite for while, but we've slowly been plodding along
on ev3dev-stretch. If you haven't tried it yet, it now is a good time. Look
for the blue box on the [downloads page](/downloads).

Some interesting new features include:
* A Visual Studio Code Extension for [easy programming](https://github.com/ev3dev/vscode-hello-python)
* The [brickrun](https://github.com/ev3dev/brickrun/blob/ev3dev-stretch/doc/brickrun.rst) command line tool
* Grayscale support for the EV3 screen
* [Adjust the CPU frequency of the EV3](https://lechnology.com/2018/06/overclocking-lego-mindstorms-ev3-part-2/)

If you run into any problems, be sure to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/issues).
